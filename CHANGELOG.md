## [0.4.2] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- `X402.Facilitator.Auth` behaviour and `X402.Facilitator.Auth.CDP` — per-request JWT authentication for the Coinbase Developer Platform x402 facilitator, configured via the new `auth:` option on `X402.Facilitator.start_link/1`
- `X402.Facilitator` `otp_app:` option — Ecto-style runtime configuration where `config :app, <name>` supplies options (including auth credentials) and `config/runtime.exs` is the single source of truth; explicit options take precedence
- `X402.Extensions.Bazaar.build_extension/1` — factory for the `bazaar` discovery extension payload (`info` + `schema`), supporting HTTP and MCP inputs

### Fixed

- CDP JWT `uris` claim now binds to the full request path (facilitator base URL path + endpoint) — the previous `host + /verify` binding caused the hosted CDP facilitator to reject all requests with 401 (`request_info.path` is now the fully-qualified path)
- The auth request host is now derived from the URI host and port (port included only when non-default, matching JavaScript `URL.host` semantics) instead of the deprecated `URI.authority` field, which is no longer populated on recent Elixir and failed dialyzer

### Testing

- Live smoke tests against the CDP hosted facilitator (`cdp_live_test.exs`, tagged `:smoke`, excluded from the default run) covering negative-control, authentication, end-to-end verify, and settlement tiers
- `X402.TestPayments` reworked around a `Config` struct with default values; payment configuration now comes from `from_env/1` (facilitator-agnostic `X402_*` vars only) — no hardcoded sample wallets, and end-to-end receivers default to a fresh burner wallet (never the payer, and never the zero address, which USDC rejects)
- Removed `test_helper.exs` compile-time redefinition of `X402.Hooks` — the real module compiles cleanly and the test suite passes without the override

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Declare `:telemetry` as a required runtime dependency so telemetry events and
  facilitator calls work in downstream installs without optional dependencies
- Start the OTP `:public_key` application used by
  `X402.Facilitator.HTTP.secure_pool_opts/0`
- Exercise the library from a minimal downstream Mix project in CI to catch
  missing runtime dependencies before publishing

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- x402 v2 `PaymentPayload` validation and complete `PaymentRequirements` matching
- Extension-echo validation for server-advertised extension data
- `X402.Plug.PaymentGate.put_settlement_amount/2` for metered `"upto"` routes
- Multi-option `accepts` and v2 `ResourceInfo` support in `X402.Plug.PaymentGate`

### Changed

- `X402.Plug.PaymentGate` now verifies before the protected handler and settles only
  after a successful handler response
- Facilitator requests now use the v2 `{x402Version, paymentPayload,
  paymentRequirements}` wire format
- `"upto"` verification uses `PaymentRequirements.amount` as the authorized maximum;
  settlement uses it as the actual atomic amount charged
- Plug route prices and all documentation examples use atomic token units

### Fixed

- Fail closed when facilitator responses omit or mistype `isValid`, `success`,
  `transaction`, or `network`
- Preserve the full request URL, including its query string, in `ResourceInfo.url`
- Reject partial or mutated accepted requirements instead of matching only five fields
- Return HTTP 500 for facilitator transport failures and malformed facilitator responses
  while retaining HTTP 400 for invalid input and HTTP 402 for payment failure
- Reject unsupported `upfront` and `escrow` flows instead of applying unsafe
  authorization-flow timing
- Avoid creating atoms from untrusted string route keys
- Compile cleanly without optional SIWX crypto dependencies and return
  `:missing_dependency` when the default verifier cannot load them

### Migration

- Replace the removed Plug option `facilitator_url:` with a supervised
  `X402.Facilitator` process and pass it via `facilitator:`.
- Replace decimal display amounts such as `"0.01"` with atomic-unit strings such as
  `"10000"` for six-decimal USDC.
- Hook callbacks use `context.payload` / `context.requirements` and return
  `{:cont, context}`, `{:halt, reason}`, or `{:recover, result}` as documented by
  `X402.Hooks`.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Payment signature format validation and SIWX ETS size cap (#39)
- Tightened Solana address validation and warn on missing idempotency cache (#36)
- Enforce `https://` scheme on facilitator `base_url` — prevents plaintext credential leakage (#35)
- Added 8KB payload size cap to `PaymentRequired` and `PaymentResponse` to prevent oversized payloads (#34)
- TLS peer verification enabled by default and `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header size cap (#32)

### Changed

- Bumped minimum Elixir to `~> 1.19` (#33)
- Optimized decimal parsing and centralized utility functions (#37)

### Added

- Unit test for `HTTP.secure_pool_opts/0` (#38)

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Safe cache eviction with bounded cleanup to prevent full-table scans under load (#30)
- Atomic payment claim in PaymentGate plug to prevent double-settlement on concurrent requests (#30)
- SIWX ETSStorage read consistency — route `get` through GenServer to prevent revoked session reads (#31)
- Full-jitter exponential backoff in Facilitator.HTTP to prevent thundering herd on retries (#31)
- Base.decode64 padding safety in PaymentSignature and PaymentRequired (#31)


## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Fixed unbounded ETS cache growth vulnerability (DoS) — added `max_size` config with LRU eviction (#17)

### Added

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added

  - `X402.Extensions.SIWX.ETSStorage` — default ETS adapter with TTL and periodic cleanup
  - `SIGN-IN-WITH-X` header encode/decode

  - `PaymentRequired` encode/decode for `"upto"` scheme with `maxPrice`

  - Facilitator client support for upto verification with hooks
  - `PaymentGate` Plug route config supports upto scheme
- **Payment Identifier** — Idempotency extension (#12)
  - `X402.Extensions.PaymentIdentifier` — encode/decode payment IDs in payloads

  - `X402.Extensions.PaymentIdentifier.ETSCache` — default ETS adapter with TTL
- **Lifecycle Hooks** — Behaviour-based hooks for verify/settle (#10)

  - `on_verify_failure/2`, `on_settle_failure/2`
  - Context struct with request metadata, result, and error tracking

### Changed

- `ex_secp256k1` and `ex_keccak` are now optional dependencies (only needed for SIWX)
- ETS storage uses `:protected` access with direct reads bypassing GenServer for better concurrency

### Fixed

- Credo strict compliance: implicit `try`, redundant `with` clauses
- Dialyzer: unreachable pattern matches in PaymentIdentifier and SIWX Verifier
